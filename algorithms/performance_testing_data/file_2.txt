With Intel's Embree ray-tracing kernels using the Intel ISPC built version on each OS, there was around an 8% performance uplift going from the 7950X to 9950X on each operating system. But the Ubuntu Linux performance continued to lead in raw performance to the extent of the Ryzen 9 7950X on Linux was similar to the Ryzen 9 9950X performance on Windows 11.
Embree benchmark with settings of Binary: Pathtracer ISPC, Model: Asian Dragon. Ubuntu 24.04: Ryzen 9 9950X was the fastest.

With the "Asian Dragon" scene being rendered by Embree binaries on each OS, under Linux was a greater generational uplift. Going from the Ryzen 9 7950X to 9950X on Windows was a 13.6% improvement but under Linux that was a 18.3% improvement while the Linux performance was also faster than Windows overall.
Embree benchmark with settings of Binary: Pathtracer ISPC, Model: Asian Dragon Obj. Ubuntu 24.04: Ryzen 9 9950X was the fastest.

The greater generational uplift on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS going from the Ryzen 9 7950X to 9950X was also observed on another render scene with Intel Embree.
With WebP image encoding there were generational improvements on both Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux going from the Ryzen 9 7950X to 9950X. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS each time was faster than Windows 11. The Ryzen 9 7950X saw a larger boost switching to Linux from Windows 11 than the closer results on the Ryzen 9 9950X.
Kvazaar benchmark with settings of Video Input: Bosphorus 4K, Video Preset: Slow. Ubuntu 24.04: Ryzen 9 9950X was the fastest.

With the Kvazaar H.265 video encoder there was slightly better 7950X to 9950X uplift on Linux. Under Windows with the H.265 4K slow video encoding was a 5.9% improvement on Windows 11 but 8.4% under Ubuntu Linux.
Kvazaar benchmark with settings of Video Input: Bosphorus 4K, Video Preset: Medium. Ubuntu 24.04: Ryzen 9 9950X was the fastest.

With 4K content encoded at the medium preset with Kvazaar, Windows 11 with the Ryzen 9 9950X was 6% faster while Ubuntu was 8.3% faster with the Zen 5 desktop processor.
Kvazaar benchmark with settings of Video Input: Bosphorus 4K, Video Preset: Ultra Fast. Ubuntu 24.04: Ryzen 9 9950X was the fastest.

Kvazaar H.265 encoding consistently was seeing more uplift on Linux when going from the Ryzen 9 7950X to a 9950X.
Kvazaar benchmark with settings of Video Input: Bosphorus 1080p, Video Preset: Slow. Windows 11: Ryzen 9 9950X was the fastest.

With Full HD video encoding content, the Ryzen 9 7950X to 9950X uplift was around 8% for Windows and 11% for Linux, but Windows 11 was overall faster at 1080p encoding than Ubuntu Linux.

So let's take a look at how I am seeing Windows 11 running on the Ryzen 9 9950X (and 7950X) with my productivity-minded tests against Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
